= Create Gateway Service with .NET
:navtitle: Create Gateway Service with .NET

_5 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn how you can 
build microservices using ASP.NET Core. During this lab you will 
create a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction/[.NET (Core)^] is a 
is a free, open-source development platform for building many kinds of apps, from web, serverless, mobile, desktop and console apps.

You can create .NET apps for many operating systems, including Windows, Linux and MacOS on a variety of hardware. .NET lets 
you use platform-specific capabilities, such as operating system APIs. Examples are Windows Forms and WPF on Windows .NET is open 
source, https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT[using MIT and Apache 2 licenses^] .NET is a project of the https://dotnetfoundation.org/[.NET Foundation.^]

pass:[.NET] supports a number of programming faces and development environments, but today we will be looking at C# inside OpenShift Dev Spaces.

We will also be using the standard web server pattern provided by ASP .NET libraries for creating non-blocking web services.

== .NET Gateway Project 

The **gateway-dotnet** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the project laid out in different subdirectories according to ASP .NET best practices:

image::dotnet-gateway-project.png[Gateway Project,340]

This is a minimal .NET project with support for asynchronous REST services. 

`*Examine 'Startup.cs' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet/** directory.

See how the basic web server is started with minimal services, health checks and a basic REST controller is deployed.

[source,java]
----
// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCors();

    services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(options=> 
    {  
            options.JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreNullValues = true;
    });

    services.AddHealthChecks();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    
    ProductsController.Config();

    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseCors(builder => builder
            .AllowAnyOrigin ()
            .AllowAnyHeader ()
            .AllowAnyMethod ());

    app.UseHealthChecks("/health");

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });

}

----

`*Examine 'ProductsController.cs' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet/Controllers** directory.

[source,java]
----
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")] // <1>
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Products> Get()
    {            
        private static HttpClient catalogHttpClient = new HttpClient(); // <4>
        private static HttpClient inventoryHttpClient = new HttpClient(); 

        try
        {
            // get the product list
            IEnumerable<Products> productsList = GetCatalog(); // <2>

            // update each item with their inventory value
            foreach(Products p in productsList) // <3>
            {
                Inventory inv = GetInventory(p.ItemId);
                if (inv != null)
                    p.Availability = new Availability(inv);
            }    

            return productsList;
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Using Catalog service: " + catalogApiHost + " and Inventory service: " + inventoryApiHost);
            Console.WriteLine("Failure to get service data: " + e.Message);
            // on failures return error
            throw e;
        }
    }

    private IEnumerable<Products> GetCatalog()
    { 
        var data = catalogHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/catalog").Result; 
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<Products>>(data);
    }
    
    private Inventory GetInventory(string itemId)
    {
        var data = inventoryHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/inventory/" + itemId).Result;
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Inventory>(data);
    }

}
----
<1> Not unlike the Quarkus and Spring boot apps previously built, the ProductsController has a single defined REST entrypoint for GET */api/products*
<2> In this case the Get() service first requests a list of products from the Catalog microservice
<3> It then steps through each in turn to discover the amount of product in stock. It does this by calling the Inventory service for each product.
<4> By using an HttpClient class for each service, .NET will efficiently manage the connection handling.

The location or binding to the existing Catalog and Inventory REST services is determined at runtime.

== Deploy on OpenShift

It's time to build and deploy your service on OpenShift. 

As you did previously for the Inventory and Catalog services in the earlier chapters, you need to `*build a new Component and then Deploy it in to the OpenShift cluster*`

We are still going to use OpenShift S2I, but this time we will invoke it using the OpenShift CLI (oc commands). 
We will also get S2I to compile the application, create the .NET artefact .dll and then create a container.

There are two ways to get OpenShift S2I to build from source:

* Point S2I at the git repo of the source code
* Upload the source code and get S2I to build from that

Since we are exploring the Inner Loop and we might have made code changes locally in the IDE we will use the "Upload" method.
We will go through 4 steps to get the Gateway service running:

* Create an S2I Build for the .NET application with `oc new-build`
* Start the build by uploading the source with `oc start-build`
* Create a new application (a deployment) in OpenShift for the application with `oc new-app`
* Expose the application using a Route (so that we can easily test it) with `oc expose`

oc create route edge gateway-coolstore --service=gateway-coolstore

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`

====

Once this completes, your application should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the application in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 


== Test your Service

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Gateway Service*`

image::openshift-gateway-topology.png[OpenShift - Gateway Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirected to **your Gateway Service running on OpenShift**.

image::gateway-service.png[Gateway Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have an array of json output like this but with many more products.

Look in the json to see how the *Gateway service* has combined the *product* information together with the *inventory* (quantity) information: 

[source,json]
----
[ {
  "itemId" : "329299",
  "name" : "Red Fedora",
  "desc" : "Official Red Hat Fedora",
  "price" : 34.99,
  "availability" : {
    "quantity" : 35
  }
},
...
]
----

== Service discovery

You might be wondering how the Gateway service knows how to contact the *Catalog* and *Inventory* services. 
These values can be injected as environment variables at runtime for example if running the component locally in the IDE, 
but by default we have hardcoded the name of the OpenShift *Services* and then use OpenShift local DNS to resolve these names as 
the application starts. You can see the code that consumes those variables below. This is from *ProductsController.cs class* in the 
**/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet/** directory.

[source,java]
----
public static void Config()
{
    try
    {
        // discover the URL of the services we are going to call
        catalogApiHost = "http://" + 
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_CATALOG_COOLSTORE_HOST", 
                "catalog-coolstore") + ":" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_CATALOG_COOLSTORE_PORT", 
                "8080");                   
        
        inventoryApiHost = "http://" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_INVENTORY_COOLSTORE_HOST", 
                "inventory-coolstore") + ":" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_INVENTORY_COOLSTORE_PORT", 
                "8080");

        // set up the Http conection pools
        inventoryHttpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(inventoryApiHost);
        catalogHttpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(catalogApiHost);
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Checking catalog api URL " + catalogApiHost);
        Console.WriteLine("Checking inventory api URL " + inventoryApiHost);
        Console.WriteLine("Failure to build location URLs for Catalog and Inventory services: " + e.Message);
        throw;
    }
}
----
You can try this simple name service discovery for yourself in the Gateway service pod by `*selecting the Gateway
service and then the running Pod.*`

You can test the connectivity by `*selecting the Pod Terminal*` and by `*executing these shell commands in the terminal window:*`
